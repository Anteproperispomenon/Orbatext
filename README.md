A simple program to help fit level names for Commander Keens 4-6.

Introduction
============

In Commander Keen 4-6, level names and level entry text are stored
in executable segments that are sized just large enough to fit them. 
This makes it difficult to create a new set of level names and level
introductions, since they have to each fit in the same set of boxes
that the original game uses. This is especially true when using 
more levels than the original games have.
